FIT-INIT is a Smart AI Self Defence and yoga trainer.
Self defence is a great way to protect yourself,but not everyone can do it besides learning it, self defence also help physical and mental health.
There have been so many cases of people struggling from body pain and torn muscles because of doing it in the wrong manner.
So we wanted to build something which can assist and guide a user properly and correctly while he/she is either learning self defence or performing Yoga Asan through an AI assistant. 

## What we have for you ðŸ˜€

-We have designed your learning journey in more easy and interesting way by dividing it into different levels with varying difficulty. With each level of difficulty you will learn more difficult self defence and yoga poses.<br/>                               
-A platform that will teach women self defence online without any hassle of offline classes where they can learn at their own pace without any time constraint.

What's fighting without fitness? 

we know yoga is important for fitness so we have added AI yoga trainer  for the same.
The Web Application user interface (UI) will be relatively straightforward. We will aim at 90%-95% accuracy rate for detecting correct self defence and yoga poses.The ML feature will assist you in performing the  poses with high degree of angle precision.
